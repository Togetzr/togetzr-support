# Flutter Build Failure: Missing RustdeskImpl Type

## Root Cause

The Flutter build is failing because `RustdeskImpl` type is not found. This happens when:
1. The `generated_bridge.dart` file is missing or incomplete
2. The bridge artifact wasn't restored correctly
3. The bridge generation step failed

## Error Details

```
Error: Type 'RustdeskImpl' not found.
Files implicated: 
- lib/models/platform_model.dart
- lib/models/native_model.dart
```

## Solution

The `generated_bridge.dart` file is generated by the `generate-bridge` job and downloaded as an artifact. The workflow should:
1. ✅ Generate bridge files (job: `generate-bridge`)
2. ✅ Download bridge artifact (step: "Restore bridge files")
3. ❌ **ISSUE:** Flutter build fails because `RustdeskImpl` is not found

## Verification

The `generated_bridge.dart` file should contain:
- `abstract class RustdeskImpl` (line 16)
- `class RustdeskImplImpl implements RustdeskImpl` (line 1675)

Both classes exist in the file locally, so the issue is likely:
1. The artifact doesn't contain the file
2. The file path is wrong
3. The file wasn't generated correctly in CI

## Next Steps

1. Check if `generated_bridge.dart` exists in the bridge artifact
2. Verify the artifact restore step is working
3. Check if the bridge generation step succeeded

**Status:** Investigating bridge artifact generation and restoration
